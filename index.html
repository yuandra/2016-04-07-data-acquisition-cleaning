<h2>General Information</h2>

<!--
  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
  This website is for the data acquisition and cleaning training.
    The training will talk about how to get data using web and mobile based survey tools and how to clean up data using Open Refine.
    This workshop is for any researcher who want to learn how to get data and no prior computational experience is required.

    This workshop including the template of this website is based on <a href=http://datacarpentry.org>Data Carpentry</a> workshops.
</p>
<p>
We will cover {{page.day1_am}}, {{page.day1_pm}}, {{page.day2_am}} and {{page.day2_pm}}.

Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively. By the end of the workshop learners should be able to more effectively collect and clean data and be able to apply the tools and approaches directly to their ongoing research.

  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.
