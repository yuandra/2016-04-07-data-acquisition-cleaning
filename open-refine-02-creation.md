### Getting the sample data

Imagine yourself as a researcher/journalist that want to do research on the US government procurement contracts. To do your research you would have to see government procurement contact via government open data portals.

If you're lucky, the data would be presented in a clean format that you can use like here [https://myit-2014.itdashboard.gov/data_feeds](https://myit-2014.itdashboard.gov/data_feeds)

However, what happens if the data not been cleaned yet - like this version here [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1moXxo-MYjF32VpmTB8oXcB07lwjyMdNGpvyfSIssfjE/edit#gid=1208452939](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1moXxo-MYjF32VpmTB8oXcB07lwjyMdNGpvyfSIssfjE/edit#gid=1208452939)

Then you would have to clean the data yourself. In this training we shall see how we can clean this US government contract data in order for us to be able to analyse the data.


Download the data as a CSV data :
- click on "File" menu in the menu bar on the top
- hover on the "Download" menu and choose "comma separated value, CSV" file
- save the file on your computer and take note where it is
