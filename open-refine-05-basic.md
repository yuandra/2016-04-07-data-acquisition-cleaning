### Open Refine basic data cleaning operation

Open Refine provides some very useful data cleaning operation that you can try.

Those operation such as :

- trim leading and trailing whitespace
- trim consecutive whitespace
- make uppercase
- make lowercase
- make titlecase

This operation is done per column :
- click on the arrow bar beside the column name
- choose edit cells
- choose common transform
- choose trim leading and trailing whitespace
- repeat on the other columns

### Exercise
- try to do some basic data cleaning operations on the table columns

### Google Refine Expression Language

You can also do more powerful transform by using GREL. GREL has almost the same function with excel function, however it might have a different syntax. A lot of the commands that we are using now can actually be done by GREL also.

You can check the documentation of GREL in here : [https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/General-Refine-Expression-Language](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/General-Refine-Expression-Language)

### Exercise

Let's try some GREL ! Follow the instructor example
