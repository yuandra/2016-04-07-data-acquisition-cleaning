### Collaboration with Google Forms

Google forms allow you to collaborate with each other

- you can share the data file (google sheets)
- or you can share the form design (google form)
- sharing the google form design also shares the data

How to start collaboration

- click on ... section in the top right of the form
- click on add collaborators

There are two ways to add collaborators 

- by sending the link

Google form provide a link that you can copy paste to the other people.
However you will need to set up permission for the link first by clicking "change" in the permission dialog

- by sending via email

If you put the email address of people you want to collaborate with, google forms will auto add them to your form

### Exercise

- set your sharing permission to public
- in pairs, send your form collaboration request to each other
- add a question to the each other's form

### Prefilled form

Besides sharing the form as a blank form, you can create a pre-filled form that already has some of its question filled

- go to ... section in the top right position of the form
- get prefilled form link
