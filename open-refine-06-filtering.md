### Using Filter to select data

Besides facet, Open Refine also provides a filter functionality in which you can filter text.

- click on the arrow beside the column name 
- select text filter

### Exercise

You can also use Regular Expression which we use during the data validation in Google Form for us to have better fine grained controls in searching the data

Hint : use online tools like regexr.com to test your regular expression.
