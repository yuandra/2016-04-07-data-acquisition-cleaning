### Distributing form using Kobo Toolbox

To distribute the form you create there are several steps :

- deploy a project that uses the form
- open the form in our preferred platform (web, android, iOS)

### Deploying a project

- make sure you are in the form screen, where you can see a list of form in kobo toolbox
- hover on top of the form you wish to deploy and click the button deploy as a new project
- enter the new title and project id that you wish
- click deploy and view project

You will then be taken to the project screen. This will be your main area to deploy, view, and analyse the data of the form you created.

Note that the Puffin Browser has a few limitations :
- you can't upload pictures by taking them when you're filling the form. You have to get the picture first, saved the picture in camera roll, and then select the picture from the camera roll when you want to fill the form.

### Theming in Kobo Toolbox

Compared to Google Forms, Kobo Toolbox sadly does not offer much in the sense of theming. 

The build options that Kobo Toolbox has is when getting data from the web view, which only have the option to change the paging :

- single page view
- multiple page view

If you want to do more than that or want to modify how the form looks like on the mobile device then you'll have to fork the mobile client or make your own.

The other options that Kobo Toolbox has is groupings, that means you group questions with each other. 

To do that, select the question you want to be grouped, and select group question in the form design.
