### The Open Refine Interface

You will see the Open Refine main interface once you load the project. This would be your main window when you work with Open Refine.

There are 3 areas that you should put your main attention to :

- the column name, this will be how you access the Open Refine functions
- your data, as it will show the data you are currently working with
- history, where you can see all the steps that you have done

### Basic Column Manipulation

You can click on the the individual arrow on the side of the column name to do column manipulation.

Some of the notable function are :

- Hiding column/collapse column
Means that we're hiding the column from view
How : click on arrow bar beside the column name, select view, and collapse column

- Rename column
Means that we rename the column
How : click on the arrow bar beside the column name, select edit column, rename column

- Reorder the column
Means that we reorder the column position
How : click on the arrow bar beside the all column name, select reorder column

- Change the data type in the column
Means that we change the data in the column to be a data type such as text or number
How : click on the arrow bar beside the column name, select edit cell, common transform, and select the format that you want

- Sorting the column
Means that we sort the contents of the column
However when doing sort we need to make note to make it "permanent"
How : click on the arrow bar beside the column name, select sort
to make permanent, see the sort text on top right, click on it and set make permanent
