### Validation in Kobo Toolbox

Data validation in Kobo Toolbox is checking the value of the data entered into a specific value.

Let's try set up a validation.

- Choose a question and go to question settings
- choose validation criteria to show the validation settings
- enter the validation criteria
- enter the error message

Try out the form. You will recieve an error message when you put a value that is not equal to the validation value.

### Exercise

Try to put validation in the age by making people that fill the form must be > 18 years of ago
