Let's make a form !

For example, we are a researcher that want to research about people preference. We want to do a study on the perceptions people have towards individuals wearing glasses  vs contact lenses based on first impressions and also the decision factors for choosing to wear either.

Make a new title for the form :

- click on add Title and Description
- change it to "Glasses vs Contact Lens"

Adding a question :

- click on add question in the right
- set the type of the question by clicking on question type
- add the question details like title and hint

### Viewing the form

After you've edit the question, click on the view live form in the top right

Your google form will be shown 

Try filling it out !

After you fill it, go back to your form editing page, and click on view responses.

You will see the data that you've just put in. Now you see that it is very easy for you to get the data out from google forms.
Congratulations ! You have created your first google form !

### Exercise
