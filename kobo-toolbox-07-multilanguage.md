### Multi language in Kobo Toolbox

Kobo Toolbox provide a method to design a form using spreadsheet.
The method will be using XLSForm, a file format of XLS but yet using a certain rule so that it can represent a form.
You can upload and download XLS form to Kobo Toolbox.

Check more on the XLSForm [http://xlsform.org](http://xlsform.org)

- try download the XLSForm of the mobile buildings survey

You can also add a question directly on the form by editing it and filling the respective column

### Exercise

Add a question to the kobo toolbox, "where do you live ?" , with the type is text and import it back into kobo toolbox.
Remember to change the form title and the form id to avoid conflict with existing forms.

### Adding multiple language support

By editing the XLSForm file, you're also able to add translation of your form in different languages.

The way to do that is by adding a column called label:LanguageName (for example label:Australia) beside the label column in the XLS File.

example :

| label               | label:Japanese           |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| What is your name ? | あなたのお名前は何ですか |


###Exercise

Work in pairs with the one beside you and add one / two languages to the XLSForm and upload it to Kobo Toolbox. 
Try deploying it and see how it looks like in the mobile device
